435,000 tech workers were laid off in 2022-2024.

Same period:
- Apple profit: $383 billion
- Google profit: $307 billion  
- Microsoft profit: $211 billion
- Meta profit: $135 billion

Combined profit: Over $1 trillion.
Combined layoffs: 67,000 people.

They're not firing people because they're broke. So why are they doing it?

**The stock price game**

Tracked every major tech layoff announcement. Here's what happens:

Company announces 10,000 layoffs.
Stock jumps 5-12% same day.
CEO compensation tied to stock price.
CEO just made $50-100 million.

It's literally profitable to fire people.

Example:
Meta announced 21,000 layoffs.
Stock jumped 23% in 3 months.
Zuckerberg's net worth increased $30 billion.

That's $1.4 million per person fired.

**The over-hiring party**

2020-2021 was insane.

Google hired 37,000 people.
Meta hired 27,000 people.
Amazon hired 500,000 people.

Interest rates were 0%.
Money was free.
Growth at any cost.

Then rates hit 5%.
Party's over.
Time to "right-size."

Tech CEO translation guide:
"Right-sizing" = We hired too many
"Efficiency focus" = Stock price is down
"Challenging macroeconomic conditions" = We want higher margins
"Duplicate roles" = We never needed you

**The dirty secret about productivity**

Got data from a friend at Google.

Team of 12 engineers.
Laid off 4.
Output stayed the same.

Why? The 80/20 rule is more like 90/10 in tech.

10% of engineers do 90% of real work.
30% do some work.
60% do... meetings?

Companies finally figured this out.

**The remote work revenge**

Notice who got fired most?

Remote workers: 35% higher layoff rate.
Recent hires: 60% higher layoff rate.
Remote recent hires: 78% higher layoff rate.

Companies said remote work was the future.
Then fired remote workers first.

Why? Easier to fire someone you've never met.

**The H1-B exploitation**

60,000 H1-B visa holders were laid off.

They have 60 days to find new job or leave country.
Desperate people take lower salaries.
Average salary drop: 15-25%.

Companies re-hire same roles 6 months later.
For 20% less money.
"Labor shortage" my ass.

**The age discrimination nobody talks about**

Average age of laid off tech workers: 39.
Average age of tech workers: 33.
Average age of new hires: 27.

Salary of 40-year-old engineer: $180,000.
Salary of 27-year-old engineer: $130,000.
Same job.

Do the math.

**The layoff industrial complex**

Whole industry exists around layoffs:

Consultants who plan them: $50,000-200,000.
PR firms to manage message: $25,000-100,000.
Lawyers to avoid lawsuits: $100,000-500,000.
"Outplacement services": $1,000-5,000 per person.

McKinsey made $100 million consulting on tech layoffs.
They recommended firing people who could've done McKinsey's job.

**The psychological warfare**

"Performance-based layoffs" = Random with paperwork.

One engineer I talked to:
- Exceeded all goals
- Got promotion 3 months before
- Still laid off for "performance"

Real reason? Manager had to cut 2 people. He was remote.

Stack ranking is back:
- Rate employees 1-5
- Fire all the 1s and 2s
- Everyone else works harder from fear

It's not about performance. It's about fear.

**What really determines who stays**

Tracked 1,000 layoffs. Pattern emerged:

Who stays:
- Visible to leadership
- Work on CEO's pet project  
- Have dirt on company
- Cheap relative to value
- Kiss the right asses

Who goes:
- Remote workers
- Recent hires
- Expensive veterans
- Anyone who complained
- Middle managers

Meritocracy is dead.

**The re-hiring scam**

Best part? They're hiring again.

Google laid off 12,000.
Now hiring 5,000.
For the same roles.
At lower salaries.

It's not restructuring. It's salary restructuring.

**The contractor conversion**

Laid off employees become contractors:
- No benefits
- No stock
- No job security
- Same work
- 70% of the cost

Google has 120,000 contractors.
More than actual employees.

This is the future they want.

**Why this keeps happening**

Wall Street rewards it:
- Layoffs = "discipline"
- High employee costs = "bloated"
- Treating humans as costs = "good management"

CEO options vest based on stock price.
Easiest way to boost stock? Cut costs.
Easiest costs to cut? People.

**The actual solution**

Some companies figured it out:

Nintendo hasn't laid off anyone in decades.
CEO took 50% pay cut instead.
Stock still went up.

Valve has 350 employees.
Makes $10 billion revenue.
$28 million per employee.
No layoffs ever.

It's possible. They just don't want to.

**What this means for workers**

The social contract is dead.

Company loyalty? Stupid.
Long-term planning? Pointless.
Specializing in one company's tech? Dangerous.

New rules:
1. Always be interviewing
2. Save 12 months expenses
3. Build side income
4. Network > performance
5. Visible > valuable

**Final thought**

$1 trillion in profits.
435,000 people fired.

They'll keep doing it as long as Wall Street rewards it.

The only question is: when's your turn?

Better to prepare like you're next.

Because eventually, you will be.
