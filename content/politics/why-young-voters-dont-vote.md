18-29 year olds make up 21% of eligible voters.

Only 48% of them voted in 2020.

That was considered a "historic turnout."

Compare that to voters over 65, where 72% showed up.

Everyone's got a theory on why young people don't vote. Politicians blame apathy. Media blames social media. Professors blame civic education.

They're all wrong.

Did some digging into actual voter data and exit polls, and here's what I found.

**Reason One - Moving is a nightmare**

Young adults move on average 2.4 times between ages 18-29.

Each move means:
- Re-registering to vote
- Finding new polling locations
- Updating voter ID requirements
- Missing registration deadlines

32% of young non-voters in 2020 said they "weren't registered" or "didn't know how to vote in their area."

Meanwhile, 68% of seniors have lived at the same address for over 10 years.

The system is literally built for people who don't move.

**Reason Two - Tuesday voting is insane**

Election day is Tuesday.

You know who works Tuesdays? Everyone under 65.

43% of workers aged 18-29 don't get paid time off.
Only 29% of young workers have flexible schedules.
Service industry workers (predominantly young) can't just "take a long lunch."

Early voting exists, but here's the kicker - 14 states don't have it at all, and in states that do, the hours are often 9-5... when young people are working.

Meanwhile, retirees can stroll in whenever.

**Reason Three - The ID problem no one talks about**

36 states have voter ID laws.

Sounds reasonable until you realize:
- 21% of citizens don't have government-issued photo ID
- That number jumps to 25% for African Americans
- And 16% for voters aged 18-24

Why? Because young people don't drive as much anymore.

In 1983, 92% of 20-24 year olds had a license.
In 2023, it's down to 80%.

In cities where most young people live, it's even lower. Why pay for a car in NYC when the subway exists?

**Reason Four - Registration is stuck in 1970**

In Estonia, 44% of people vote online.
In Australia, you're automatically registered.
In Sweden, you get your ballot mailed to you.

In America? You need to:
1. Register 30 days in advance (in some states)
2. Know your precinct
3. Bring specific documents
4. Vote at one specific location
5. Do it all over if you move

We can file taxes on our phones but can't vote on them.

**The real reason this doesn't change**

Old people vote. Young people don't.

Politicians cater to voters, not potential voters.

So the system stays designed for people who:
- Don't move
- Don't work Tuesdays
- Have plenty of IDs
- Have time to jump through hoops

It's not apathy. It's architecture.

Young people aren't lazy. The system is just built for a different generation.

Want proof? When Oregon went to 100% mail-in voting, youth turnout jumped 11%.

When same-day registration was allowed, youth voting increased by 9%.

Make voting as easy as ordering Uber Eats, and watch what happens.

Until then, stop blaming young people for not participating in a system designed to exclude them.
