1.2 million people subscribe to my YouTube channel.

I still Google "how to make good thumbnails" every week.

Last month, someone called me a "political expert" at a conference.

I laughed so hard I choked on my drink.

Expert? I'm making this up as I go along. Just like everyone else.

**The moment it hit me**

Three weeks ago, got invited to speak at Georgetown about "digital political engagement."

Me. Georgetown. Where actual political science PhD's teach.

Spent two hours Googling "what is political engagement" to make sure I wasn't about to embarrass myself in front of 200 future politicians.

That's when I realized: I have no credentials for this.

No political science degree.
No journalism background.
No communications training.
No speechwriting experience.

I'm a guy with a camera who reads news articles and gives opinions.

And somehow that's enough for 1.2 million people to care what I think?

**The comments that break you**

"Charles is the only person who makes politics make sense."

That comment has 12,000 likes.

I screenshotted it. Not because I'm proud. Because it terrifies me.

What if I'm wrong about something?
What if I misinterpret data?
What if my hot take ages like milk?
What if someone smarter fact-checks me publicly?

The pressure is suffocating.

**The research rabbit holes**

For every 10-minute video, I spend 6 hours researching.

Not because I'm thorough. Because I'm terrified of being wrong on the internet.

Last video about lobbying? 
Read 200 pages of federal disclosure forms.
Watched 8 hours of C-SPAN footage.
Called 3 former lobbyists.
Cross-referenced every statistic twice.

All for a video about how lobbying works.

Meanwhile, someone with actual experience could've explained it in 20 minutes.

**The algorithm anxiety**

YouTube analytics become your self-worth.

Good video gets 500k views: "I'm finally figuring this out!"
Next video gets 200k views: "I'm a fraud and everyone's catching on."

There's no consistency. No formula. No guaranteed success.

Just throwing content at the wall and hoping 1% sticks.

Been doing this for 3 years. Still have no idea what makes a good video.

**The expert trap**

Here's the cruel irony: The more people call you an expert, the more you realize you're not.

When I had 10k subscribers, I felt confident about everything.
At 100k, started second-guessing myself.
At 1M, I fact-check my fact-checks.

Knowledge is a circle. The bigger it gets, the more you realize is outside it.

**The comparison nightmare**

Everyone else looks like they know what they're doing.

Ben Shapiro: Harvard law degree, 15+ years experience.
Hassan Piker: Political science degree, worked at The Young Turks.
Emma Chamberlain: Started at 16, grew up online.

Me: Figured out YouTube by accident, fake it 'til I make it.

Everyone has origin stories. I have stumbled-into-this syndrome.

**The DM that changed everything**

Three months ago, got a DM from a 17-year-old:

"Your video about voting explained it better than my AP Gov teacher. I registered to vote because of you."

First thought: "That's amazing!"
Second thought: "Oh god, I influenced someone's civic engagement?"
Third thought: "What if I gave them wrong information?"

The responsibility is crushing.

**The behind-the-scenes reality**

What people see: Confident guy explaining politics.

What actually happens:
- 4 AM panic Google searches about electoral college
- Calling my friend's dad who worked in politics to verify basic facts
- Re-recording the same segment 12 times
- Having anxiety attacks about comment sections
- Questioning every word choice for 3 hours

The final video is take #47.

**The monetization guilt**

Making money from opinions feels weird.

Sponsorships pay $15,000-30,000.
Channel makes $40,000+ per month.
Newsletter grows because of political content.

Am I educating people or exploiting their interest in politics for profit?

Both?
Neither?

The line blurs every day.

**The hate comments that stick**

"This guy doesn't know anything about politics."
"College dropout pretending to be smart."
"Another unqualified YouTuber spreading misinformation."

They're not wrong. I am unqualified by traditional standards.

But here's the thing: Most of my viewers are also "unqualified."

Maybe that's why they connect with my content. I'm figuring it out in real time, just like them.

**The mentor I never expected**

My mom watched one of my videos last month.

Her feedback: "You sounded like you knew what you were talking about."

That's the whole game. Sound like you know.
Research enough to not be completely wrong.
Present with confidence.
Hope for the best.

**The realization that saved me**

Nobody knows what they're doing.

CNN anchors read teleprompters written by 22-year-olds.
Politicians vote on bills they haven't read.
"Experts" get things wrong constantly.
News organizations correct stories daily.

The difference between me and "real" journalists? They have fancy titles and better health insurance.

**The audience wisdom**

My comment sections are often smarter than I am.

Video about healthcare policy: 
Comments included nurses, insurance agents, and policy analysts explaining nuances I missed.

Video about economics:
Comments from accountants, small business owners, and finance professors adding crucial context.

Maybe my job isn't to be the smartest person in the room. Maybe it's to start conversations between people who are smarter.

**What imposter syndrome actually teaches**

It keeps you humble.
Forces you to research more.
Makes you acknowledge uncertainty.
Prevents dangerous overconfidence.

The creators who never feel like imposters? Those are the ones to worry about.

**The confession**

I don't know what I'm doing.
Neither do most people with platforms.
Neither do most "experts."
Neither do most politicians.
Neither do you.

That's not a bug. That's a feature.

We're all figuring out this complex world together.

Some of us just happen to be doing it on camera.

**The unexpected wisdom**

Maybe the best political commentary comes from people still asking questions.

Maybe expertise is overrated.
Maybe curiosity matters more than credentials.
Maybe admitting uncertainty is more honest than false confidence.

Maybe being a "fraud" who researches everything is better than being an "expert" who assumes they know everything.

**Final thought**

1.2 million people subscribed to watch someone figure it out in real time.

Not because I have all the answers.
Because I'm willing to look for them.
Out loud.
While being completely terrified I'm wrong.

That's apparently relatable.

Who knew?

Now excuse me while I Google "what is foreign policy" for tomorrow's video.

The imposter syndrome never ends.
But neither does the learning.

Maybe that's the point.
